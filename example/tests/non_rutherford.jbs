#Accurate mode employs adaptive integration to achieve higher accuracy when cross sections have structure and when weighting of cross sections by straggling is important. Some other approximations are also neglected. Disadvantage: it's slow. Uncomment next line to enable.
#set sim accurate

#Improved accuracy may also be achieved without adaptive integration, this simply tunes many parameters to be quite conservative. Might be about twice as slow as defaults (so still fast enough).
